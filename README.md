# LSD MCP

This is the updated MCP server for [LSD](https://lsd.so). The reason behind this update is to effectively leverage dynamic tools that are defined as [trips](https://lsd.so/docs/database/language/types/keywords/according) using [our SDK](https://github.com/lsd-so/internetdata).

## Getting started

### Authenticating

This is to connect the running MCP server with [your account](https://lsd.so/profile) by using [our SDK](https://github.com/lsd-so/internetdata/?tab=readme-ov-file#authenticating).

The reason for using the terms `user` and `password` is because what you're connecting to is our [postgres compatible database](https://lsd.so/docs/database/postgres/postgres-compatible).

#### Configuration file

In your home directory, write a JSON to a file named `.lsd` with the properties `user` and `password` with your email and an [API key](https://lsd.so/docs/database/connect/authenticating) from [your profile](https://lsd.so/profile).

```JSON
{
  "user": "<you@email.domain>",
  "password": "<api_key>"
}
```

#### Environment variables

Alternatively, you can set the environment variables `LSD_USER` and `LSD_PASSWORD`.

```bash
$ export LSD_USER='you@email.domain'
$ export LSD_PASSWORD='<api_key>'
```

**Important:** If you run into errors when taking this approach, check the environment variables set are accessible from the PATH or process the MCP client is invoking it from.

### Using an MCP registry

More coming soon.

### From source

1. Clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lsd-so/mcp.git
```

2. If you're using [Claude desktop](https://claude.ai/download), update your `claude_desktop_config.json` file ([here's a guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user#2-add-the-filesystem-mcp-server) for creating it).

```JSON
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // other MCP servers configured here...
    "lsd": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
	    "/<path>/<to>/mcp/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Extending capabilities with LSD

For scenarios where you'd like to teach the MCP client a "skill", you can do so with an [LSD trip](https://lsd.so/docs/database/trips) ([what is that?](#what-is-a-trip)).

### What is a trip?

A "trip" is a [published module](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) consisting of an LSD program whether it was derived by [interacting with our local browser](#from-the-bicycle-browser) or by [directly publishing a trip](#directly-publishing-a-trip).

### From the bicycle browser

From the Bicycle browser you can derive LSD by using our "click language", this can be activated by clicking on the transcriber icon in the top right:

![Screen recording of clicking on the transcriber icon](media/transcriber_activate.gif)

Or by pressing `Command+k` (or `Ctrl+k` for Linux/Windows). Once you've done so, you can interactively "pluck" repeating containers as well as fields of interest:

With the generated LSD, you can edit the aliases like so:

After which you can publish [using the language](#using-the-language).

### Using the language

From the workbench, simply edit to publish a trip.

## Extending capabilities with TypeScript

Check out the [internetdata SDK](https://github.com/lsd-so/internetdata) that's used under the hood to bridge with the web. Or, alternatively, get started using the [create-your-internet shorthand](https://github.com/lsd-so/create-your-internet).

```bash
$ yarn create your-internet
```

Or, if you prefer npm

```bash
$ npm create your-internet
```
